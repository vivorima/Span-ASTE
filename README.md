# Span-ASTE
Implementation of the Method: Learning Span-Level Interactions for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (Xu et al., ACL-IJCNLP 2021)

This model, named Span-ASTE, aims to address the limitations of existing approaches by considering the interactions between targets and opinions for the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) task.

It employs a span-level approach that accounts for the interactions among all targets and opinions to predict their sentiment relationship.

The three datasets we used are Rest14, Rest15 and Rest16. Link for te data used: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/sentiment-analysis-datasets
